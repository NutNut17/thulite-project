### Concept

#### Web History

| Web | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Web1 | Static pages (read) |
| Web2 | Social, centralized platforms (read/write) |
| Web3 | Decentralized, blockchain-backed apps (read/write/own) |

#### Decentralized

Take Discord and Matrix as an example. Matrix is the decentralized alternative of Discord. Data are stored decentralized among different users. A use can choose which server to store their data, but the hosting server can access the data. With Discord, you have no choice. The downside of using decentralized service is poorer network performance.

#### Blockchain

You don’t log in with a password — you use cryptographic wallets (e.g., MetaMask).

Financial systems are built-in (tokens, NFTs, DAOs — for better or worse).

Chapter 4: Network Layer - Data Plane

1. Definitions

sender: encapsulates segments into datagrams, passes to link layer
receiver: delivers segments to transport layer protocol
network layer service model: best-effort, constant bit rate, available bit rate...
floodi: a router send an incoming packet to every outgoing link except the node on which the packet arrived

2. Inside a Router

Input port function use decentralized switching. It use header field values, lookup output port using forwarding table in input
port memory. Generalized forwarding forward based on any set of header field values. While the traditional destination-based
forwarding forward based only on destination IP address by longest prefix matching.

Destination Address Range               Link Interface                   
11001000  00010111  00010*** ********   0
11001000  00010111  00011000 ********   1
11001000  00010111  00011*** ********   2
otherwise                               3

Longest prefix matching often performed using ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs). Content addressable present address
to TCAM. TCAM retrieve address in one clock cycle, regardless of table size. In Cisco Catalyst: there is about 1M routing table
entries in TCAM.

Switching Fabric

Switching rate: rate of packets can be transfer from inputs to outputs, often measured as multiple of input/output line rate
Switching by memory: (first generation routers), controlled by CPU and limited by bandwidth of system
Switching by bus: datagram from input port memory to output port memory via a shared bus
Switching by interconnection network: Scaling, using multiple switching “planes” in parallel fragment datagram into fixed
length cells on entry

Input port queuing
- When input rate is higher than switching rate, Head-of-the-Line (HOL) blocking will block queued datagram at front of queue
prevents others in queue from moving forward.

Output port queuing
- When buffer has no more space, Drop Policy will determine which datagrams to drop if no free buffers. Scheduling discipline
chooses among queued datagrams for transmission. Priority scheduling who gets best performance, network neutrality.

3. IP(Internet Protocol)

IP address: IPv4 32-bit identifier associated with each host or router interface
Interface: connection between host/router and physical link, router have multiple interfaces, host has wired Ethernet, WiFi
Subnet: device interfaces that can physically reach each other without passing through an intervening router
CIDR(Classless InterDomain Routing): Use address format a.b.c.d/x, where x is number bits in subnet portion of address
DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Host dynamically obtains IP address from network server when it “joins” network.
DHCP also return address of first-hop router for client, name and IP address of DNS sever and network mask.

Network get subnet part of IP address from portion of its provider ISP’s address space. For example:
ISP's block: 11001000  00010111  00010000  00000000    200.23.16.0/20 
ISP can then allocate out its address space in 8 blocks: 

Organization 0    11001000  00010111  00010000  00000000    200.23.16.0/23 
Organization 1    11001000  00010111  00010010  00000000    200.23.18.0/23 
Organization 2    11001000  00010111  00010100  00000000    200.23.20.0/23 
   ...
Organization 7    11001000  00010111  00011110  00000000    200.23.30.0/23 

NAT(Network Address Translation)
- All local network device share just one IPv4 address (NAT IP Address)
- Device in local network use a private IP address space(10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16 prefixes) that can only be used in local
- NAT router must switch and remember the IP of datagram local IP to NAT IP

IPv4 Classes: 
- Class A, B, and C are used by the majority of devices on the Internet. Class D and class E are for special uses. An address
consists of 4 octet and have network ID and Host ID. In each ID part, the bits could not be all 0 or all 1
Class   First octet Network ID Range            Host ID Range               Private IP Range
A       0xxxxxxx    1.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.0        X.0.0.1 to X.255.255.254    10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
B       10xxxxxx    128.1.0.0 to 191.254.0.0    X.X.0.1 to X.X.255.254      172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
C       110xxxxx    192.0.1.0 to 223.255.254.0  X.X.X.1 to X.X.X.254        192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
D       1110xxxx    224.0.0.1 to 239.255.255.254 N/A
E       11110xxx    240.0.0.1 to 255.255.255.254 N/A

- IP Range: 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.255 are network testing addresses

IPv6: 128-bit identifier with 40-byte fixed length header
XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX, X in hexadecimal. Longest consecutive 0 are displayed using ::
For example: 0:0:1:1:1:1:0:0 -> ::1:1:1:1:0:0

IPv4 to IPv6: ::ffff:XXXX:XXXX, X: IPv4

Transistion from IPv4 to IPv6(tunneling): IPv6 is stored in IPv4's payload(data)

Generalized Forwarding, match plus action using SDN

flow: defined by header field values 
match: pattern values in packet header fields
actions: for matched packet: drop, forward, modify, matched packet or send matched packet to controller 

OpenFlow abstraction
Router - match: longest destination IP prefix, action: forward out a link
Switch - match: destination MAC address, action: forward or flood
Firewall - match: IP addresses and TCP/UDP port numbers, action: permit or deny
NAT - match: IP address and port, action: rewrite address and port

Middleboxes - any intermediary box performing functions apart from normal, standard functions of an IP router on the data path
between a source host and destination host like NAT, CDN, Firewall, Cache.
Network functions virtualization (NFV) - programmable services over white box networking, computation, storage
IP fragmentation/reassembly - large IP datagram divided (“fragmented”) within net, IP header bits used to identify fragments

Chapter 5: Network Layer - Control Plane

1. Definitions
Forwarding (data plane): Move packets from router's input to appropriate router output
Routing (control plane): Determine route taken by packets from source to destination
Path: Sequence of routers packets traverse from given initial source host to final destination host
Intra: Within
Inter: Among

2. Routing Protocol

- Logically Centralized Control (software defined networking, SDN): Remote controller computes, installs forwarding tables in
routers. Global (link state algorithms): all routers have complete topology, link cost info. Computes least cost paths from one
node to all other nodes and gives forwarding table for that node. 

Dijkstra’s link-state routing algorithm:

c(x,y): direct link cost from node x to y;  = ∞ if not direct neighbors
D(v): current estimate of cost of least-cost-path from source to destination v
p(v): predecessor node along path from source to v
N': set of nodes whose least-cost-path definitively known

Initialization: 
N' = {u}
for all nodes v
    if v adjacent to u
        then D(v) = cu,v                                            */
    else D(v) = ∞
Loop:
find w not in N' such that D(w) is a minimum 
add w to N' 
update D(v) for all v adjacent to w and not in N' : D(v) = min ( D(v),  D(w) + cw,v  ) 

Example: (u,v) = 2, (u,x) = 1, (u, w) = 5, (v, x) = 2, (v, w) = 3, (x, w) = 3, (x, y) = 1, (y, w) = 1, (y, z) = 2, (w, z) = 5

Step    N'      D(v),p(v)   D(w),p(w)   D(x),p(x)   D(y),p(y)   D(z),p(z)
0       u       2,u         5,u         1,u         inf         inf         // D(x) is the minimum, add (x) into N'
1       ux      2,u         4,x                     2,x         inf         // D(y) is the minimum, add (y) into N'
2       uxy     2,u         4,x                                 4,y         // D(v) is the minimum, add (v) into N'
3       uxyv                3,y                                 4,y         // D(w) is the minimum, add (w) into N'
4       uxyvw                                                   4,y         // D(z) is the minimum, add (z) into N'
5       uxyvwz


- per-router control (traditional): Individual routing algorithm components in each and every router interact in the control
plane. Decentralized (distance vector algorithm): iterative process of computation, exchange of info with neighbors routers
initially only know link costs to attached neighbors.

Bellman-Ford (BF) equation (dynamic programming): Dx(y) = min v{c(x,v) + Dv(y)} for each node y ∊ N

Each Node wait for (change in local link cost or msg from neighbor), recompute DV estimates using DV received from neighbor, if
DV to any destination has changed, notify neighbors. The forwarding stops when there is no more change in the node's link cost

3. Intra-ISP Routing: OSFP

Network is very huge and it's imposibble to save the link cost to all destination. Autonomous System, AS or known as domain
used to solve this. Gateway router perform inter-domain routing and as well as intra-domain routing.

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) routing is a classic link-state advertisement that flood all the router in entire AS then
calculate the shortest path. This can be used in hierarchical OSFP which the AS is divided to backbone. The backbone area have
boundary router, connecting to other AS and run OSFP limited to backbone (outer OSFP). While local routers have area border
router that summarize distances to destinations in it's own area (inner OSFP), advertise in backbone and local routers compute
routing within area.

4. Routing among ISP: BGP(Border Gateway Protocol)

The protocol that connects Internet inter-AS. Allows subnet to advertise its existence, and the destinations it can reach, to
rest of Internet.

BGP provides each AS a means to:
eBGP: obtain subnet reachability information from neighboring ASes
iBGP: propagate reachability information to all AS-internal routers.

Chapter 6: The link Layer and LAN

1. Parity Checking:

Single bit parity: check for even number of 1's
Two dimensional: detect and correct single bit errors
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC):

D: data d bits to be sent
G: key k that is generated to be used as divisor of modulo 2

The data is multiplied by 2 ^ (k - 1) bits, or shifted left by k - 1 times. Then perform like division but using XOR instead of
subtraction. The remainder will be append to d, to the data sent is <d, r>, where the ramainder r is checkbits

Example: 101110

    _______101011
1001/   101110000
        1001
          1010
          1001
            1100
            1001
             1010
             1001
              011(R)

Encoded data: 10111011

Do 10111011 xor 1001 if the remainder is 0000, then there is no error

2. Multiple Access Channel (MAC)

point-to-point: direct link
broadcast / channel: shared wire or medium

MAC protocols

Channel Partitioning:

Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) - A channel is divided to fixed length slot, the channel is sent in rounds
Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) - Channel spectrum divided into frequency bands

Random Access:

Channel not divided, allow collisions, recover from collisions, nodes take turns, nodes with more to send can take longer turns

Slotted ALOHA - Every node have equal probability to transmit frame at each slot(time interval) in the beginning of a slot.
When a node is chanelling, other node cannot transmit until the node that is channeling stops foward the frame, then,the slot
will end. In the beginning of a slot, if collisions occurs(multiple node sending), the slot will and start a new slot. Best
probability for every node: 1 / e = 0.37. Efficiency: 37%
Pure ALOHA - Older version of ALOHA, but without a slot(time interval), every node is given random time to retransmit without waiting
for the chanelling node to end. Collisions happens frequently. Efficiency: 18%
Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) - If channel sensed idle: transmit entire frame, if channel sensed busy: defer transmission 
CSMA/CD (CSMA with Collision Detection) - Collisions detected within short time, colliding transmissions aborted, reducing channel wastage
CSMA/CA (CSMA with Collision Avoidance) - Used in WiFI

Ethernet CSMA/CD algorithm

1. NIC receives datagram from network layer, creates frame
2. NIC senses channel: if idle: start frame transmission, if busy: wait until channel idle, then transmit
3. If NIC transmits entire frame without collision, NIC is done with frame !
4. If NIC detects another transmission while sending:  abort, send jam signal
5. After aborting, NIC enters binary (exponential) backoff: after mth collision, NIC chooses K at random from {0,1,2, …, 2m-1}.
NIC waits K·512 bit times, returns to Step 2 more collisions: longer backoff interval

Taking Turns:

Channel partitioning efficient at only high load, while random access efficient at low load, taking turns is in the between.
Bluetooth uses this. 

Polling - Master node invites control nodes to transmit. Cons: Latency in poling and single point of failure
Token Passing - Control token passed from one node to next sequenctially. Cons: Overhead latency and single point of failure
Cable Access Network - Multiple upstream and downstream channel.
Multiple access - All users contend (random access) for certain upstream channel time slots, others assigned TDM
DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specificaiton) - FDM over upstream, downstream frequency channels, TDM on upstream,
some slots assigned, some have contention. Request for upstream slots transmitted random access (binary backoff) in selected slots

3. Link Layer Roadmap

MAC address (48-bit) is used in same subnet. Run getmac in window terminal to get yout device's mac address. Each LAN has
48-bit MAC address and 32-bit IP address. Example: 1A-2F-BB-76-09-AD

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): Each IP node have ARP table to remmember mapping for IP address, MAC address, and TTL. The
ARP will broadcast and get the MAC address of desired node.

Routing to another subnet:
A: 111.111.111.111, 74-29-9C-E8-FF-55
B: 222.222.222.222, 49-BD-D2-C7-56-2A
Router Port to A: 111.111.111.110, E6-E9-00-17-BB-4B
Router Port to B: 222.222.222.220, 1A-23-F9-CD-06-9B

A sent a frame to Router with source 111.111.111.111, 74-29-9C-E8-FF-55 to 222.222.222.222, E6-E9-00-17-BB-4B. Then router send
to B with source 111.111.111.111, 1A-23-F9-CD-06-9B to 222.222.222.222, 49-BD-D2-C7-56-2A

Ethernet:

Ethernet Frame - preamble(used to synchronize), 48-bit destination and source address, type bits, data(payload), CRC
Ethernet(802.3) - Unreliable, connectionless, No handshake and ACKs, unslotted CSMA/CD. Common MAC and frame protocol format 
Ethernet Switch - Examine the incoming frame's MAC address and foward to the outgoing links using CSMA/CD.
Every host have dedicated connection to switch, switch buffers packets. This method does not have collisions and it's full
duplex. But no more than one input can be sent to the same output simultaneously. Each switch has a switch table that records
the destination when a frame is received from a source to switch. If the switch dont't know the actual output, it will flood
all of the outgoing links 

Router is network Layer, use IP address. Switch is link Layer, use MAC address.

VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network):

Switches supporting VLAN capabilities can be configured to define multiple virtual LANS over single physical LAN infrastructure.

Port-based VLAN - Traffic isolation, ports from 1~8 can go to 1~8 even the switch have 16 ports. Vlan can be defined by MAC
address. Port can be dynamically assigned among VLANs
VLAN spanning multiple switches - A trunk port on each side is used to carries frames between VLANs defined over multiple
physical switches. It needs 802.1q protocol to add 12-bit additional header fields for frames forwarded between trunk ports

MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) link virtualization:

Forwarding among network of MPLS-capable routers. Use destination and source addresses to route flows to same destination
differently (traffic engineering). Pre-computed backup paths to re-route flows quickly if link fails. Entry MPLS router uses
RSVP-TE signaling protocol to set up MPLS forwarding at downstream routers.

IP path: Different source to same destination use same path (Less efficient)
MPLS path: Different source to same destination have different path (More efficient)

Chapter 7: Wireless and Mobile Networks

1. Wireless

CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)

Unique code assigned to each user all users share same frequency, but each user has own code to encode data allows multiple
users to coexist and transmit simultaneously with minimal interference if codes are orthogonal

Encoding: inner product: (original data) X (chipping sequence)

Sender 1:

Data-bit, d1(i)    -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 | 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
Code, c(m)          1  1  1 -1  1 -1 -1 -1 | 1  1  1 -1  1 -1 -1 -1
Z1(i,m)=d1(i)c1(m) -1 -1 -1  1 -1  1  1  1 | 1  1  1 -1  1 -1 -1 -1

Sender 2:
Data-bit, d2(i)     1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1 | 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
Code, c2(m)         1 -1  1  1  1 -1  1  1 | 1 -1  1  1  1 -1  1  1
Z2(i,m)=d2(i)c2(m)  1 -1  1  1  1 -1  1  1 | 1 -1  1  1  1 -1  1  1

Z1(i,m) + Z2(i,m)   0 -2  0  2  0  0  2  2 | 2  0  2  0  2 -2  0  0

Decoding: summed inner-product: (encoded data) X (chipping sequence)

Sum(Z(i, m)c(m)) / M (for Receiver 1)

Zsum(i, m)  0 -2  0  2  0  0  2  2 | 2  0  2  0  2 -2  0  0
c1(m)       1  1  1 -1  1 -1 -1 -1 | 1  1  1 -1  1 -1 -1 -1
Sum         0 -2  0 -2  0  0 -2 -2 | 2  0  2  0  2  2  0  0 = -8 | 8
Sum / M     1 | -1 (Equal to the data-bit sender 1 wants to send)

WiFi - 802.11

BSS (Basic Service Set) or Cell: Wireless hosts, AP (Access Point ex: base station), ad hoc mode (hosts only)
AP admin chooses frequency for AP when a host arrives

CSMA / CA Collision Avoidance

1. Sender first transmits small request-to-send (RTS) packet to BS using CSMA
2. RTSs may still collide with each other (but they’re short)
3. BS broadcasts clear-to-send CTS in response to RTS
4. CTS heard by all nodes
5. Sender transmits data frame
6. Other stations defer transmissions 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extra Notes: (My own network issues)

- To setup a router. Set my pc as DHCP and type 192.168.1.1 on the browser to set the static IP address on the router. Then the
router can work.

- It is posibble to send files through ethernet connecting two pc

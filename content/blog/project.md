### 2025 Jan | System Design Full Stack Application

Developed a full-stack e-commerce web application using Vue.js, Node.js (Express.js), SQL, and PrimeVue UI Library. Led version control using GitHub, coordinated team collaboration, and deployed the project to the cloud via Docker on Render (PaaS).

I learned basic understanding of how full-stack developement works, system design patterns, development practice, responsive design, and mobile UI development.

#### Role

I took the lead in selecting the right tech stack, designing the system architecture, and delegating tasks to each team member. However, driven by enthusiasm, I ended up handling most of the project myself, leaving only some CRUD backend tasks and the main shopping page to my teammates.

### 2024 Dec | Graduation Topic Project - AI Application

#### Abstract

This project, "Dummy Chef Assistant: Generative AI-Controlled Recipe Recommendation System," integrates Gemini API to detect image ingredient and algorithms to recommend suitable recipes based on the identified ingredients. By utilizing a precise algorithm to match ingredients with recipes, the system aims to provide recommendations that best meet user needs, enhancing user satisfaction. The system includes both a mobile app and a web interface, offering diverse and user-friendly operation platforms.

#### Role

Built an AI-based ingredient recognition system that recommends suitable recipes. Developed the frontend interface and trained a model with Yolov8 to identify and analyze over 100 ingredients. Eventually, implemented the final version using Gemini for ingredient recognition and recipe recommendations.

We have two bot, alpha and beta. Alpha will be controlled manually through controller and stops when it detects an obstacle. While beta will follow wherever alpha go through computer vision. When alpha wants to move backwards, it will send signal and beta will move backwards together to avoid collision between two bot.

#### Role

Lead the development of the system, optimize performance of the system, and trained tiny Yolov4 model for image recognition.
